### Hey there 🖐

My name is Satchel and I'm an university student in South Korea.  
I'm mainly interested in web development and my goal is to become a full-stack developer.  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js & Nest.js.
- 🤔 I prefer backend to frontend.
- 😐 I have zero interest in designing. 
- 🛒 I'm also thinking about learning GO and/or ASP.NET someday.
